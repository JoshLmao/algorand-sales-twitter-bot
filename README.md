# Setup

- Make twitter account for bot. This bot will create the developer app and tweet out
- Go to developer portal, create Developer App **on Bot Account**
- Setting, User authentification settings, click Edit
    - Check the boxes to enable Oauth 2.0, 1.0a
    - **Type of app**: Automated app or bot
    - **App permissions**: Read and write
    - **Callback**: `https://localhost:3000`
    - **Website**: Your website
- Keys and tokens, Access Token and Secret, click Regenate to get `accessToken` and `accessTokenSecret`
- Save API keys and access keys. Put them in .env
- You also need to apply for "Elevated" API access
    - Select "Products" on the left panel and select "Twitter API v2"
    - Select "Elevated" at the top. Click the prompt and provide extra information needed

Once done, you will have obtained the relevant Twitter API variables needed. The last thing you need is an `authorization` token from NFTx. Obtain one by going to https://api.nftexplorer.app

Set the variables in the `.env` file to your obtained values.

## Creating a Droplet *(Optional)*

You'll want somewhere to run this, I advice this step if you know what you're doing, otherwise skip to [how to run the bot](#run) 

I suggest using Digital Ocean. Sign up, create a Droplet of Ubuntu, Basic, Regular with SSD, choose location, configure SSH keys, Create droplet

After initializing, open the console of the droplet, run the following commands
- `git clone https://github.com/JoshLmao/algorand-sales-twitter-bot.git ./twitter-bot`
- `cd ./twitter-bot`
- `sudo apt update`
- `sudo apt install nodejs`
- `sudo apt install npm`
- `sudo apt install node-typescript`

Once done, make sure you configure the .env with your setting. 
- `nano ./.env` and enter each variable.
- `Ctrl + X` to exit
- `Y` to confirm save
- `Enter` to confirm the file

Then, simply run `npm start` and let do it's thing üòé

# Run

- `npm install` to install all required packages
- `npm start` to build and run the script with the current `.env` configuration

# Customization

You can customize the output tweet of the bot by changing the Typescript function [`FormatSaleToTweet()`](./src/monitor.ts#L29)
