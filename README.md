# Setup

- Make twitter account for bot. This bot will create the developer app and tweet out
- Go to the [Twitter developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/), create Developer App **on Bot Account**
- Setting, User authentification settings, click Edit
    - Check the boxes to enable Oauth 2.0, 1.0a
    - **Type of app**: Automated app or bot
    - **App permissions**: Read and write
    - **Callback**: `https://localhost:3000`
    - **Website**: Your website
- Keys and tokens, Access Token and Secret, click Regenate to get `accessToken` and `accessTokenSecret`
- Save API keys and access keys. Put them in .env
- You also need to apply for "Elevated" API access
    - Select "Products" on the left panel and select "Twitter API v2"
    - Select "Elevated" at the top. Click the prompt and provide extra information needed

Once done, you will have obtained the relevant Twitter API variables needed. The last thing you need is an `authorization` token from NFTx.

## Creating a Droplet *(Optional)*

You'll want somewhere to run this, I advice this step if you know what you're doing, otherwise skip to [how to run the bot](#run) 

I suggest using Digital Ocean. Sign up, create a Droplet of Ubuntu, Basic, Regular with SSD, choose location, configure SSH keys, Create droplet

After initializing, open the console of the droplet, run the following commands
- `git clone https://github.com/JoshLmao/algorand-sales-twitter-bot.git ./twitter-bot`
- `cd ./twitter-bot`
- `sudo apt update`
- `sudo apt install nodejs`
- `sudo apt install npm`
- `sudo apt install node-typescript`

# Update the `.env`

Make sure you configure the .env with your obtained values

- Linux
    - `nano ./.env` and enter each variable.
    - `Ctrl + X` to exit
    - `Y` to confirm save
    - `Enter` to confirm the file
- Windows
    - Edit the file in a text editor. Right click an open in Notepad. 
    - Set the variables, save the file.

## Minimum Sale Requirements

You can set either the `MIN_USD_PRICE` and `MIN_ALGO_PRICE` variables if you wish for the bot to only tweet sales that are above or equal to that price requirement. These can be left blank to not need the requirement, such as if you only want one USD or ALGO requirement, or both left blank for no requirement at all.

# Run

Before running, make sure to do the [Update the `.env`](#update-the-env) steps

- `npm install` to install all required packages. Should be run before any attempt to run
- `npm start` to build and run the script with the current `.env` configuration

# Updating

If you wish to update, do the following

- `git pull` to get the latest changes from the repo
    - Note: if there are merge conflicts, you can do `git stash` to save your changes, allowing you to do `git pull` and then run `git stash pop` to apply it again
    - *Warning:* You might have merge conflicts when running `git stash pop`. I suggest either managing the merge yourself or running `git reset --hard origin/main` and redoing your changes

Once done, you can do the same command [in run](#run) to run the bot

# Customization

## Easy Way

You can edit the `tweet-format.json` file with a custom format to customize how the bot tweets out. Simply replace the `format` value with an appropriate format and the bot will use it to tweet. You can use `\n` for a new line character to place the following on to the next line.

For example
```
"format": "üëÄ {name}\nüèß {algos}\nüí∞ {usdPrice}\nü§ù {shortReceiver}\n{nftxUrl}",
```

| Key | Example | Description |
| --- | ----- | ----------- |
| `{name}` | CGF #420 | The name of the NFT |
| `{nftxUrl}` | https://www.nftexplorer.app/asset/582495036 | The NFTx URL of the asset. Provide this to get metadata on the asset in the tweet, such as displaying the NFT image |
| `{assetId}` | 582495036 | Asset ID of the NFT |
| `{usdPrice}` | 21.37 | Sale price in dollars (USD) |
| `{location}` | Rand Gallery | Location the sale took place on. Check NFTx for a full list of supported marketplaces |
| `{algos}` | 25 | Sale price in Algos |
| `{ualgos}` | 25000000 | Sale price in uAlgos, which is regular algos multiplied by 10^6
| `{shortReceiver}` | `6SNY...RRRI` | Receiver address shortened to display the first and last 4 characters, with an elipse in between |
| `{receiver}` | `6SNY5BGSS7DKQMTTU5IIL63ZQCSVM45VHJJP7T6X2ZLHRXESAJQO55RRRI` | Full Algorand address of the buyer |
| `{epochMs}` | `1645391880000` | [Refer to this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now) for more information on how time works in coding |
| `{dateShort}` | 20/02/2022, 21:18 | A short readable string of the date and time of the sale |


## Hard Way: Code

You can customize the output tweet of the bot by changing the Typescript function [`FormatSaleToTweet()`](./src/monitor.ts#L69). This step requires some coding knowledge

# Linux Help

Below is some helpful commands to use the `twitter-bot.service` systemctl file and the `start.sh` script

If you are having any issues with systemctl, make sure the `WorkingDirectory` value in the `twitter-bot.service` file is to the right directory.

- `chmod +x start.sh` to have permission on the utility start script
- `cp ./twitter-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/twitter-bot.service` to copy the systemctl service file from the local directory to the systemctl directory
- `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to reload systemctl to the current services
- `sudo systemctl enable twitter-bot.service` to enable on every reboot. Only need to run once
- `sudo systemctl start twitter-bot.service ` to start the service
- `sudo systemctl status twitter-bot.service` to see the current output
- `sudo systemctl restart twitter-bot.service` to restart the current service
- `sudo systemctl stop twitter-bot.service` to stop the service if running
